                <p id="about_text">My name is <strong>Nina Potrebich.</strong><br>
                I moved to Seattle from Russia with my family. I worked before as an electrical engineer. But different countries use different technologies in power electrical systems and it is not so easy to find a job in that area. I always thought about becoming a software developer. I encountered with coding at work but mostly as reader and interpreter and I was thinking that I want to write code by myself.<br>
                When we moved to Seattle area I had to spend some time not working, waiting to get permission for work. So I started going through different courses about coding. I started from Python. Than I went through data and algorithms course. Found online bootcamp "freecodecamp". But it was not thorough so I had to take more detailed courses along the way. At some point I realised that is too much what I want to learn. Maybe I need to choose what I want exactly and not to learn everything. <br>
                I started applying for jobs. But without experience you got no answer. So I started looking for bootcamps with internship. During internship you can get real working experience and your profile would be looking not so bald. And it is a possibility to stick to company where you had internship.
                So far I am enjoying being in Epicodus. It is not possible to learn everything. You always have something to learn and areas where you can improving.</p>
